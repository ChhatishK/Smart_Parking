# Smart_Parking

This system is very impresive and helpful for car parking easily.

In this system, ultrasonic sensor is connected to the every slot of the car parking area and sense the presence of car and send the signal to the LCD screen.

Then, LCD screen is able to show the status of parking area. If parking slot is empty then it will show total numbers of empty slot with slot numbers, and if not slots are empty it will show no slots are empty and parking is full.

This system is fully automated means no human interaction needed to work this system.
